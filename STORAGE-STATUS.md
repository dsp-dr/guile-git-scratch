# 🗄️ Storage Status: From Lies to Files

## Evolution of Our Git Server

### Phase 1: Professional Lying
- ✅ Accepted connections
- ✅ Said "unpack ok"  
- ❌ Actually stored nothing
- Status: Convincing fiction

### Phase 2: Plain Text Truth
- ✅ Accepts connections
- ✅ Says "unpack ok"
- ✅ **ACTUALLY STORES DATA!**
- Status: Naive but honest

## Current Storage System

### Plain Text Philosophy
- No SQLite, no JSON, no complexity
- Everything visible with `cat`, `ls`, `grep`
- Perfect for debugging and understanding
- Fits the minimal server approach

### Directory Structure
```
data/
├── pushes/    # Timestamped push logs
├── refs/      # Reference storage (repo/ref.txt)
├── objects/   # Object files (sha.txt)
└── repos/     # Repository metadata
```

### What We Actually Store

#### Push Logs (data/pushes/)
```
20250820-075348-guile-git-scratch.git
20250820-075438-guile-git-scratch.git
```

Each file contains:
- Timestamp and repo name
- Initial request line
- Commands received
- Pack data info (if any)

#### References (data/refs/)
```
repo-name/
├── heads-main.txt     # Contains SHA
├── heads-develop.txt  # Contains SHA
└── tags-v1.0.txt      # Contains SHA
```

### Testing Results
```bash
# Our server is running with storage!
git push dogfood main

# Check what got stored:
ls data/pushes/    # Shows timestamped push files
cat data/pushes/*  # Shows actual request data
```

### The Beautiful Truth
Our server now:
1. **Listens** on port 9418 ✅
2. **Accepts** Git protocol connections ✅
3. **Parses** push requests ✅
4. **Stores** push data to plain text files ✅
5. **Responds** with honest "unpack ok" ✅

We've graduated from lying to naive storage. This is character development!

## How to Use It

### Start the Storage Server
```bash
# Kill old server
tmux kill-session -t guile-git-server

# Start storage version
tmux new-session -d -s guile-git-server "./minimal-server-storage.scm"

# Watch it work
tmux attach -t guile-git-server
```

### Push to It
```bash
git push dogfood main
```

### Inspect Storage
```bash
# See push attempts
ls -la data/pushes/
cat data/pushes/*

# Check refs (when we actually store them)
ls -la data/refs/

# Look for objects (future feature)
ls -la data/objects/
```

## Next Level Storage

### What Works Now
- Logging all push attempts
- Storing request data
- Timestamping everything
- Plain text debugging

### What's Next
- Parse pack files properly
- Extract and store actual objects
- Update reference files
- Handle object retrieval

### Storage Philosophy
We're not building SQLite. We're building something you can debug with `cat`. This is intentionally naive storage that prioritizes:
- Visibility (see everything)
- Simplicity (no dependencies)
- Debuggability (plain text all the way)
- Honesty (store what we say we store)

## The Dogfood Gets More Nutritious

Our Git server implementation has evolved from a convincing mime to an honest filer. It receives Git pushes and stores them as plain text. You can literally `cat` the push attempts and see what Git is sending us.

This is still dogfood, but now it's dog food with actual ingredients listed on the label.
