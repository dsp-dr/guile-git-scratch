# üêï TESTING LOG: 10 Rounds of Dogfooding + Origin Commits

## Testing Methodology 

This log documents 10 rounds of commits pushed to both `origin` (GitHub) and `dogfood` (our local Git server) to test the complete development workflow and identify any issues.

**Testing Protocol:**
1. Make meaningful changes to the codebase
2. Commit with conventional commit messages
3. Push to GitHub (`origin`) first
4. Push to dogfood server (`dogfood`) second  
5. Document any failures, timeouts, or unexpected behavior
6. Generate AI analysis when possible
7. Continue regardless of failures (messy repo shows real work!)

**Expected Issues:**
- Dogfood server may not be running initially
- Git protocol timeouts due to minimal implementation
- Pack file handling not yet implemented
- Some commits may fail but we continue testing
