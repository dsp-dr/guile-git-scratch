Woof woof! The developer just pushed their changes to the 'test-doghouse' repository 🏡 and it sounds like they were trying to communicate with their localhost server on port 9418. Looks like someone's project is growing furiously, as if a new puppy was added to the team! 🐾

=== Original Push Data ===
git-receive-pack /test-doghouse.git host=localhost:9418
