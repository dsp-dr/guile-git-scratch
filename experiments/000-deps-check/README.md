# Experiment 000: Environment and Dependencies Check

## Goal
Verify that the FreeBSD development environment has all required dependencies for implementing a Git client/server in Guile3.

## Hypothesis
The system should have Guile 3.x, necessary SRFIs, FFI support for zlib, and GNU Make available.

## Implementation
Check for required tools and libraries.

## Results
- Guile version: [TO BE FILLED]
- FreeBSD version: [TO BE FILLED]
- Available SRFIs: [TO BE FILLED]
- Zlib availability: [TO BE FILLED]
- GNU Make: [TO BE FILLED]

## Integration Notes
Any missing dependencies will need to be installed before proceeding.

## Next Steps
- Experiment 001: Analyze WYAG book structure
- Set up any missing dependencies
