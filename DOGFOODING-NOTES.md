# 🐕 Dogfooding Notes: The Journey of Eating Our Own Git Food

## The Philosophy: "Ship It and Eat It"

We're implementing Git in Guile, and we're using it to develop itself. This is either brilliant or insane. Possibly both.

## Current Reality Check

### What Our Server Actually Does ✅
- Listens on port 9418 like a real Git server
- Says "Hello" in Git protocol speak
- Accepts your push with grace
- Then immediately dies 💀
- One connection per life - it's very dramatic

### What It Pretends To Do 🎭
- "Oh yes, I'll take that push"
- "Absolutely, I'm storing your objects"
- "unpack ok" (narrator: nothing was unpacked)

### What It Should Do Eventually 🚀
- Actually parse pack files
- Store objects somewhere
- Update references
- Not die after one connection (unless we want it to)

## The Dogfooding Experience So Far

### Episode 1: "The Server That Could (Once)"
```
Developer: "Let's push to our Git server!"
Server: "Connection received! I'm a real Git server!"
Developer: "Great! Here's my commit!"
Server: "Handling receive-pack!" *dies*
Developer: "...Server?"
Server: *silence*
```

### Episode 2: "The Tmux Session Saga"
```
Developer: "I'll put you in tmux so you keep running"
Server: "Starting minimal Git server on port 9418"
Developer: *pushes*
Server: "Connection received!" *handles it* *exits gracefully*
Tmux: "Your process has exited. Press any key to close."
Developer: "At least it's graceful..."
```

### Episode 3: "The Daemon Awakens"
```
Developer: "Fine, I'll make you a daemon"
Server-Daemon: "I shall run forever!"
Developer: "Can you actually store anything?"
Server-Daemon: "...I shall run forever!"
```

## Honest Dogfooding Metrics

| Feature | Status | Honesty Level |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Accepts connections | ✅ Working | 100% real |
| Git protocol handshake | ✅ Working | 100% legit |
| Receives push data | ✅ Kind of | We see it, we just ignore it |
| Stores objects | ❌ Nope | "unpack ok" is a lie |
| Updates refs | ❌ Nada | What refs? |
| Stays running | 🤔 Depends | One-shot or daemon, your choice |

## Dogfooding Achievements Unlocked 🏆

- **"First Contact"**: Successfully received a Git protocol connection
- **"The Pretender"**: Responded "unpack ok" without unpacking anything
- **"One and Done"**: Server successfully handles exactly one connection
- **"Tmux Master"**: Kept server "running" in a tmux session
- **"It's Alive!"**: Created daemon version that actually stays alive

## Dogfooding TODO: Making It Real

- [ ] Actually parse pack data (stop pretending)
- [ ] Store objects for real (implement the lie)
- [ ] Update references (make pushes meaningful)
- [ ] Send real responses (honesty in protocols)
- [ ] Handle multiple connections (already done in daemon!)

## The Dogfood Versioning Scheme

- **v0.0.1**: "It listens!" 
- **v0.0.2**: "It responds!"
- **v0.0.3**: "It pretends really well!"
- **v0.0.4**: "It might actually store something!"
- **v0.1.0**: "OK, it's actually Git now"
- **v1.0.0**: "We replaced GitHub with this" (dream big)

## Quotes from the Development Process

> "The server is running! ...Was running. It was running."

> "It says 'unpack ok' so professionally, you'd never know it's lying."

> "One connection per server instance is a feature, not a bug. It ensures freshness."

> "We're dogfooding! The dog food just happens to be... conceptual."

## How to Dogfood Right Now

### The Honest Version
```bash
# Start the server (pick your fighter)
./minimal-server.scm          # Dies after one connection (testing mode)
./minimal-server-daemon.scm   # Stays alive (production mode)

# Try to push
git push dogfood main

# Watch it handle the connection beautifully
# Then watch your commits go into the void
# This is fine. This is dogfooding.
```

### The Marketing Version
"Our Git server implementation successfully handles Git protocol connections and responds with appropriate status messages following Git standards!"

## Final Wisdom

We're not just eating our own dog food. We're cooking it ourselves, from scratch, in Guile, while the kitchen is still being built. And honestly? The server stays up for entire milliseconds at a time. That's enterprise-grade stability right there.

Remember: Every great Git implementation started by lying about unpacking objects. Probably.
