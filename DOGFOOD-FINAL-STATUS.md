# üêï FINAL DOGFOODING STATUS REPORT

## Mission: Accomplished* 
*Terms and conditions apply

### What We Built
- A Git server in Guile that accepts real Git pushes
- It runs in tmux (professional!)
- It responds with valid Git protocol messages
- It says "unpack ok" with confidence

### Dogfooding Achievements Unlocked
- ‚úÖ Server running in tmux session `guile-git-server`
- ‚úÖ Successfully received multiple Git push attempts
- ‚úÖ Protocol handshake working perfectly
- ‚úÖ Server responds appropriately (lies professionally)
- ‚úÖ Created both one-shot and daemon versions

### The Beautiful Lies Our Server Tells
```
Client: "Here's my push!"
Server: "unpack ok"
Client: "Great! Are my objects stored?"
Server: *whistles innocently*
```

### Actual Server Logs from Real Pushes
```
[2025-08-20 07:44:42] Connection received
Request: 0040git-receive-pack /guile-git-scratch.githost=localhost:9418
Handling receive-pack
```

### How to Experience the Magic Yourself
```bash
# The server is RUNNING RIGHT NOW in tmux!
tmux attach -t guile-git-server

# Push something to it!
git push dogfood main

# Watch it handle your push like a champion!
# (Then watch your commits disappear into the quantum realm)
```

### Next Steps for Real Functionality
1. Actually parse the pack data we receive
2. Store objects (make the lie true)
3. Update refs (complete the illusion)
4. Achieve full Git compatibility (the dream)

### Philosophy Victory
We are successfully dogfooding! The fact that the dog food is currently just flavored air doesn't diminish the achievement. We're using our Git server to develop our Git server. It's receiving our pushes about making it receive pushes. This is peak meta-development.

## The Server Lives! üöÄ
Check tmux session: `guile-git-server`
Port: 9418
Status: ACCEPTING CONNECTIONS AND LYING ABOUT STORAGE
